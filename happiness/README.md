The sign and magnitude of each coefficient indicate the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\n### Interpretation of Coefficients\n1. **Negative Coefficients**:\n   - **-0.1317**: Suggests that for each one-unit increase in this predictor, the dependent variable decreases by approximately 0.1317 units, assuming all other variables are constant.\n   - **-0.0036**: Indicates a very small negative effect, implying a negligible impact on the dependent variable.\n   - **-0.0159**: Similar to the above, this is a small negative relationship.\n   - **-0.3822**: Indicates a stronger negative relationship, suggesting that this predictor has a considerable negative effect on the dependent variable.\n   - **-0.5114**: This is the most significant negative coefficient, implying that this predictor greatly reduces the value of the dependent variable.\n\n2. **Positive Coefficients**:\n   - **0.0133**: This small positive coefficient indicates a minimal positive effect on the dependent variable.\n   - **0.1312**: Represents a moderate positive relationship, suggesting that increases in this predictor lead to increases in the dependent variable.\n   - **0.4982**: This coefficient suggests a significant positive effect, indicating that increases in this predictor lead to substantial increases in the dependent variable.\n   - **0.7646**: This is the largest positive coefficient, suggesting a very strong positive relationship with the dependent variable.\n\n### Insights\n1. **Identify Key Predictors**: The predictors with large negative coefficients (-0.5114 and -0.3822) are likely to be key factors that negatively impact the dependent variable. Conversely, the predictor with the largest positive coefficient (0.7646) is likely a crucial factor for positively influencing the outcome.\n\n2. **Negligible Impact**: The small coefficients (-0.0036 and 0.0133) indicate that these predictors may not significantly influence the dependent variable and could potentially be considered for removal from the model if they do not contribute to predictive power.\n\n3. **Strength of Relationships**: The varying magnitudes of the coefficients suggest that some predictors are far more influential than others. This can guide prioritization in interventions.\n\n### Actionable Recommendations\n1. **Focus on Significant Predictors**: Prioritize strategies that enhance the impact of the predictors with the strongest positive coefficients (e.g., the variable with 0.7646) and mitigate the effects of those with the strongest negative coefficients (e.g., the variable with -0.5114).\n\n2. **Investigate Negative Influencers**: Conduct a deeper analysis to understand why the predictors with strong negative coefficients are affecting the dependent variable adversely. This could involve examining underlying causes or external factors.\n\n3. **Consider Model Refinement**: Given the presence of predictors with negligible impact, reevaluate the model to simplify it by removing these variables. This can improve interpretability and potentially enhance predictive performance.\n\n4. **Monitor Changes**: If applicable, track changes in the dependent variable as modifications to the predictors are made based on these insights. This will help in assessing the effectiveness of any implemented strategies.\n\n5. **Further Research**: Depending on the context, consider conducting additional studies or analyses to explore the relationships further, particularly for the predictors with significant coefficients, to gather more insights or identify potential interactions among variables.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you can better leverage the regression analysis to inform decision-making and improve outcomes related to the dependent variable.', 'refusal': None}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 128, 'completion_tokens': 757, 'total_tokens': 885, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_bba3c8e70b', 'monthlyCost': 0.008373, 'cost': 0.004926, 'monthlyRequests': 2}

Here are the steps to analyze the coefficients:\n\n1. **Understanding the Coefficients**: \n   - The coefficients represent the estimated change in the dependent variable (the outcome you are predicting) for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant.\n   - Based on the values:\n     - **Coefficient 1 (0.060)**: This indicates a positive relationship between the first independent variable and the dependent variable. For every one-unit increase in this independent variable, the dependent variable increases by approximately 0.060 units.\n     - **Coefficient 2 (-0.067)**: This coefficient reflects a negative relationship. For every one-unit increase in this independent variable, the dependent variable decreases by approximately 0.067 units.\n     - **Coefficient 3 (-1.087)**: This also indicates a negative relationship and suggests that for every one-unit increase in this independent variable, the dependent variable decreases by approximately 1.087 units. This coefficient has a more substantial impact compared to the other two.\n\n2. **Insights**:\n   - If the first independent variable is something like "Marketing Spend," it suggests that increasing marketing efforts could lead to a slight increase in the outcome (e.g., sales).\n   - The second independent variable could represent a factor like "Price," indicating that increasing the price might reduce the outcome (e.g., sales or customer satisfaction).\n   - The third independent variable, which has the largest negative coefficient, might represent a significant detractor, such as "Customer Complaints" or "Competitor Activity," suggesting that as these factors increase, the outcome significantly worsens.\n\n3. **Actionable Recommendations**:\n   - **Enhance Positive Factors**: Focus on increasing the first independent variable (e.g., Marketing Spend) to improve the outcome. Consider strategies to optimize marketing campaigns to maximize their efficiency and effectiveness.\n   - **Mitigate Negative Factors**: For the second independent variable (e.g., Price), evaluate your pricing strategy to find a balance that maximizes revenue without significantly harming sales. Consider conducting market research to understand price sensitivity.\n   - **Address Major Detractors**: For the third independent variable, which has the most considerable negative impact, take immediate action to understand and address the underlying issues. If this variable represents Customer Complaints, implement a customer feedback system to identify root causes and develop strategies for improvement.\n   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitor all these independent variables to assess their impact on the dependent variable and make adjustments as necessary. Consider implementing A/B testing for marketing initiatives or pricing changes to gather more data on their effectiveness.\n\nIn summary, the actionable recommendations revolve around leveraging positive influences, mitigating negative impacts, and addressing significant detractors to improve the overall outcome.', 'refusal': None}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 59, 'completion_tokens': 583, 'total_tokens': 642, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_818c284075', 'monthlyCost': 0.07250400000000001, 'cost': 0.0036750000000000003, 'monthlyRequests': 13}
